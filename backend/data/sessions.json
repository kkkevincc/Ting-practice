Our performance is in five weeks.あ？Are you part of the program they plan for Par weekend Yeah the thing is we're a tap dancing group and we need to practice on hard floors, preferably would we can practice on carpet at first, but it's important for us to be able to hear our feet hit the floor the rhythm the tapping becomes part of the music So the floors are very important exactlyact and just about everywhere on campus has carpeting.Always the stage at the student theater.Though it's a long shot we can look at the schedule, there might be some odd hours free What about in town do you think the university could help us rent a rehearsal space in a commercial dance studio in town given the situation that's not really my call I can reserve rehearsal and performance spaces on campus for you, but off campus So who would I talk to the dance department Look, let's check the theater schedule first.",
